    "architecture_overview": "Vibe Assist uses a three-component architecture. The core is a Python 'daemon' (apps/daemon) running on port 8000, which performs all the heavy lifting: it monitors a local Git repository for changes, captures screen content, and sends this data to the Google Gemini API for analysis. This daemon maintains the application's central state, including security scores and active issues, and exposes it via a FastAPI REST API.\n\nThe second component is a Next.js web application (apps/dashboard) on port 3001, which serves two purposes. It provides a rich web dashboard for users to view the detailed state from the daemon. It also acts as an API bridge, exposing a simplified endpoint (/api/checklist) specifically for the widget. This bridge fetches data from the daemon's /state endpoint and formats it.\n\nThe third component is a native macOS widget (apps/widget), which is the primary user-facing element for ambient monitoring. It polls the Next.js API bridge every few minutes to get the latest status and displays it in the macOS Notification Center or on the desktop.",

    "development_setup": "Prerequisites are Node.js (>=18), pnpm, and Python (>=3.8). First, clone the repository and run `pnpm install` in the root to install all JavaScript dependencies. Next, set up the Python environment for the backend by navigating to `apps/daemon`, creating a virtual environment (`python3 -m venv venv`), activating it, and running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Configure the necessary environment variables: create `apps/daemon/.env` and set `GEMINI_API_KEY`. To run the system, start the services in separate terminals. In one terminal, run the Python daemon: `cd apps/daemon && python -m src.daemon /path/to/your/project`. In another terminal, start the Next.js apps from the root directory: `pnpm dev`. This will typically start the landing page on port 3000 and the dashboard on port 3001. The macOS widget can be run from Xcode by opening `apps/widget/VibeAssist/VibeAssist.xcodeproj`."
