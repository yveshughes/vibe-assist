It provides real-time security vulnerability detection, AI-powered commit analysis, and proactive coding suggestions by monitoring git repositories and screen activity. The system's commit analysis functionality has been simplified to only process new commits that occur while the daemon is running, removing the capability to process a backlog of historical commits on startup. The system can also perform a one-time, lightweight analysis of a codebase to generate a baseline project context document, scanning all files except for a set of hardcoded common directories. The native macOS widget component has been simplified, removing decorative UI elements and auxiliary features like the menu bar launcher to focus on core data display.",

The middle tier, a Next.js application (`apps/web`), provides a web dashboard and an API bridge (`/api/checklist`) for the top tier\u2014the native macOS Widget (`apps/widget`).
