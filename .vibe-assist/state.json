    "description": "A comprehensive code monitoring and security analysis tool that combines a Python AI backend (Daemon), a Next.js web application/API bridge, and a native macOS widget. The web application has been streamlined to function purely as a user-facing dashboard and an API endpoint for the widget, removing its previous role as a public marketing website. It provides real-time security vulnerability detection, AI-powered commit analysis, and proactive coding suggestions by monitoring git repositories and screen activity. The system's commit analysis functionality has been simplified to only process new commits that occur while the daemon is running, removing the capability to process a backlog of historical commits on startup. The system can also perform a one-time, lightweight analysis of a codebase to generate a baseline project context document, scanning all files except for a set of hardcoded common directories. The native macOS widget component has been simplified, removing decorative UI elements and auxiliary features like the menu bar launcher to focus on core data display.",

The Python Daemon (`apps/daemon`) acts as the core intelligence, running a multi-threaded FastAPI server for git and screen monitoring. The git watcher thread has been simplified to monitor for changes from the current repository HEAD, removing the logic to process historical commits that occurred while the daemon was offline. A key feature is the on-demand context initialization via an API endpoint, which scans the entire project excluding a predefined set of common directories. The middle tier, a Next.js application (`apps/web`), provides a web dashboard and an API bridge (`/api/checklist`) for the top tier\u2014the native macOS Widget (`apps/widget`). This web application has been refactored to focus exclusively on this functional role, with all marketing and landing page components removed. The overall state management is intentionally ephemeral, with the removal of issue management endpoints and duplicate-checking, resulting in a direct 'append-only' stream of AI-generated suggestions. The previous feature of logging AI interactions has been removed to simplify the system.",
