# Project Context: Vibe Assist

## Overview
A comprehensive code monitoring and security analysis tool that combines a Python AI backend (Daemon), a Next.js web application/API bridge, and a native macOS widget. The web application has been streamlined to function purely as a user-facing dashboard and an API endpoint for the widget, removing its previous role as a public marketing website. It provides real-time security vulnerability detection, AI-powered commit analysis, and proactive coding suggestions by monitoring git repositories and screen activity. The system's commit analysis functionality has been simplified to only process new commits that occur while the daemon is running, removing the capability to process a backlog of historical commits on startup. The system can also perform a one-time, lightweight analysis of a codebase to generate a baseline project context document, scanning all files except for a set of hardcoded common directories. The native macOS widget component has been simplified, removing decorative UI elements and auxiliary features like the menu bar launcher to focus on core data display.

## Architecture
Vibe Assist uses a three-tier architecture. The Python Daemon (`apps/daemon`) acts as the core intelligence, running a multi-threaded FastAPI server for git and screen monitoring. The git watcher thread has been simplified to monitor for changes from the current repository HEAD, removing the logic to process historical commits that occurred while the daemon was offline. A key feature is the on-demand context initialization via an API endpoint, which scans the entire project excluding a predefined set of common directories. The middle tier, a Next.js application (`apps/web`), provides a web dashboard and an API bridge (`/api/checklist`) for the top tier—the native macOS Widget (`apps/widget`). This web application has been refactored to focus exclusively on this functional role, with all marketing and landing page components removed. The overall state management is intentionally ephemeral, with the removal of issue management endpoints and duplicate-checking, resulting in a direct 'append-only' stream of AI-generated suggestions.

## Key Directories
- **apps/daemon**: The core Python backend service responsible for all AI analysis, git monitoring, and screen capture.
- **apps/web**: The Next.js web application that serves as a dashboard and an API bridge between the Python daemon and the macOS widget. It has been refactored from a marketing landing page to a purely functional application.
- **apps/widget**: The native macOS widget written in Swift, which displays the final analysis results.
- **apps/docs**: A separate Next.js application for project documentation.
- **packages/ui**: Shared React components used across the Next.js applications.
- **packages/eslint-config**: Shared ESLint configurations for the monorepo.
- **packages/typescript-config**: Shared TypeScript configurations for the monorepo.
- **.vibe-assist**: Stores project-specific data generated by the tool, such as the context.md file. It no longer uses a dedicated ignore file for configuring analysis scope. This directory should be excluded from version control.

## Project Goals
- ⬜ Provide real-time security vulnerability detection on uncommitted code changes.
- ⬜ Analyze new commits for alignment with the project charter.
- ⬜ Offer proactive coding suggestions by analyzing the developer's screen.
- ⬜ Expose a clean REST API for integration with frontends and widgets.
- ⬜ Maintain a simple in-memory state representing the project's health and security status, known as 'Project Cortex'.
- ⬜ Bridge the backend analysis to a native macOS widget for ambient monitoring.
- ⬜ Enable AI-powered prompt engineering to assist developers with complex tasks.
- ⬜ Perform a one-time, lightweight analysis of the codebase to generate a baseline project context document.

## API Endpoints
- **GET /api/checklist**: Exposed by the Next.js app (`apps/web`) for the macOS widget. It fetches state from the Python daemon and transforms it into a widget-friendly checklist format.
- **GET /state**: Exposed by the Python daemon (`apps/daemon`). Returns the current in-memory state of the monitored project, including security score and active issues.
- **GET /health**: Exposed by the Python daemon. A simple health check to verify the service is running and the Gemini client is initialized.
- **POST /oracle/generate_prompt**: Exposed by the Python daemon. An AI prompt engineering endpoint that takes a user's goal and a screenshot to generate an optimized, unstructured text prompt for another AI model.
- **GET /docs**: Exposed by the Python daemon. Serves interactive FastAPI documentation (Swagger UI).
- **POST /context/initialize**: Exposed by the Python daemon. Triggers a lightweight analysis of the codebase to generate a baseline `context.md` file and initialize the project charter in memory.

## Key Functions & Classes
- **main** (`apps/daemon/src/daemon.py`): The main entry point for the Python daemon. It initializes state, starts background threads for watching and screen analysis, and runs the FastAPI server.
- **analyze_fast_path** (`apps/daemon/src/analysis.py`): Performs rapid security analysis on uncommitted git diffs. No longer uses a strict JSON schema for the response.
- **analyze_deep_path** (`apps/daemon/src/analysis.py`): Performs a simplified analysis of a new git commit to check its alignment with the project charter, but no longer updates the charter itself.
- **analyze_screen_proactively** (`apps/daemon/src/analysis.py`): Analyzes a screenshot of the developer's screen using a simplified AI prompt to identify potential coding improvements. It adds all found suggestions to the active issues list without checking for duplicates.
- **initialize_project_context** (`apps/daemon/src/analysis.py`): Performs a one-time, lightweight scan of the codebase to generate an initial project charter and a `context.md` file. It no longer respects a user-defined ignore file, instead using a hardcoded list of common directories to exclude.
- **start (watcher)** (`apps/daemon/src/watcher.py`): The main loop in the watcher thread. It starts monitoring from the current repository HEAD and continuously checks for new commits and uncommitted changes. It no longer processes historical commits that occurred while the daemon was offline.
- **start (screen)** (`apps/daemon/src/screen.py`): The main loop in the screen analysis thread. It periodically captures the screen and sends it for proactive analysis.
- **GET (checklist route)** (`apps/web/app/api/checklist/route.ts`): The Next.js API route handler that fetches data from the daemon's `/state` endpoint and formats it for the macOS widget, providing a fallback if the daemon is unavailable.

## Component Interactions
- **macOS Widget** → **Next.js Web App** (API Call): The Swift widget sends a GET request to `/api/checklist` every 15 minutes to refresh its data.
- **Next.js Web App** → **Python Daemon** (API Call): The `/api/checklist` route handler makes a GET request to the daemon's `/state` endpoint to fetch real-time analysis data.
- **Watcher Thread (Daemon)** → **Analysis Module (Daemon)** (Function Call): The watcher thread detects new commits and uncommitted changes as they occur and calls `analysis.analyze_fast_path()` or `analysis.analyze_deep_path()`. It no longer scans for and processes a backlog of commits upon startup.
- **Screen Thread (Daemon)** → **Analysis Module (Daemon)** (Function Call): The screen thread captures a screenshot and calls `analysis.analyze_screen_proactively()` with the image bytes.
- **Analysis Module (Daemon)** → **Google Gemini API** (External API Call): All analysis functions within the `analysis` module make authenticated requests to the Google Gemini AI API to generate insights.
- **Analysis Module (Daemon)** → **In-Memory State** (State Mutation): Analysis functions acquire a thread lock and update the shared `state` dictionary. Proactive screen analysis now appends suggestions directly without performing duplicate checks.

## Coding Patterns & Conventions
- Monorepo with Shared Packages: Uses Turborepo and pnpm workspaces to manage multiple applications and share code (UI components, configs).
- Multi-threaded Background Tasks: The Python daemon uses threading to run concurrent, non-blocking tasks for git watching and screen analysis.
- In-Memory State Management with Thread Lock: A global dictionary serves as the single source of truth, with a `threading.Lock` to ensure thread-safe updates. The system avoids reliance on persistent state for core monitoring loops, such as tracking the last analyzed commit across restarts.
- API Gateway / Bridge Pattern: The Next.js app acts as a bridge, providing a stable, simplified API for the widget while abstracting the more complex backend daemon.
- Simplified AI Interaction without Strict Schemas: Relies on general text or simple JSON responses from the AI model, removing the overhead of strict schema validation frameworks like Pydantic.
- Environment-based Configuration: Configuration is managed through environment variables (`.env` files) for secrets and runtime parameters. File-based configuration (like the previous `.vibe-assist.ignore`) has been removed in favor of hardcoded logic for simplicity.
- Graceful Fallback: The Next.js API provides a fallback response when the backend daemon is unavailable, ensuring the widget displays a helpful message instead of failing.
- Separation of Source Code and Generated Artifacts: Generated artifacts like `context.md` are stored in the `.vibe-assist` directory, which is intended to be excluded from version control, separating them from the source code.

## Development Setup
The project is a monorepo managed by pnpm and Turborepo. To set up, run `pnpm install` in the root. For the Python daemon in `apps/daemon`, create and activate a virtual environment, then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. An essential `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable must be set. It is recommended to add the `.vibe-assist/` directory to the project's `.gitignore` file. Start the system with the Python daemon (`python -m src.daemon /path/to/project`) and the Next.js app (`pnpm dev`). The web app runs on port 3000, the daemon on port 8000. To initialize the project context for the first time, send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/context/initialize`.
